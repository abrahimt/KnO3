# KnO3 - Rusty Knight Chess Engine

We plan on building a chess engine in Rust using basic chess ideas. Some of our targets are to make it possible to play a full 
game against a user and to be able to calculate the best move given a certain situation. A long-term goal would be to build 
a Python GUI to make things more user-friendly.
