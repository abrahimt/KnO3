/// Struct representing a chessboard with piece positions and game state.
///
/// Each `piece` is a uint64 bitboard, where each bit represents the presence of a piece
/// on the corresponding square. The bit at index `i` represents the presence of a piece on
/// the square at rank `i/8` and file `i%8`.
///
/// # Fields
///
/// - `black_pawns`: Bitboard representing the positions of black pawns.
/// - `black_rooks`: Bitboard representing the positions of black rooks.
/// - `black_knights`: Bitboard representing the positions of black knights.
/// - `black_bishops`: Bitboard representing the positions of black bishops.
/// - `black_queen`: Bitboard representing the position of the black queen.
/// - `black_king`: Bitboard representing the position of the black king.
/// - `white_pawns`: Bitboard representing the positions of white pawns.
/// - `white_rooks`: Bitboard representing the positions of white rooks.
/// - `white_knights`: Bitboard representing the positions of white knights.
/// - `white_bishops`: Bitboard representing the positions of white bishops.
/// - `white_queen`: Bitboard representing the position of the white queen.
/// - `white_king`: Bitboard representing the position of the white king.
/// - `white_turn`: Boolean indicating whether it's white's turn to move.
/// - `castling_rights`: 4-bit value representing the castling rights, where the bits represent
///   kingside and queenside castling rights for both black and white.
/// - `en_passant`: 6-bit value representing the square that has en passant ability (1-64),
///   or 0 if there is no en passant square.
///
/// Note: The board is represented as a set of bitboards for each piece type, and the
/// `en_passant` square is represented using 6 bits, allowing values 1-64 to represent each
/// square on the board. The `castling_rights` field uses 4 bits to represent kingside and
/// queenside castling rights for both black and white.
